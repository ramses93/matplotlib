# matplotlib

## Overview
We are taking what we've learned about Python Matplotlib and applying it to a real-world situation and dataset. As a senior data analyst at the company, I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

## Conclusion
Capomulin proved to be very affective whe treating the mice. Tumor sizes decreased over the 45 day period, over more than 50% of the mice showed a decrease in tumor volume that were treated with Capomulin.
